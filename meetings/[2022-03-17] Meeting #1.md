## Discussion

From the discussion we had, we came up with our **aim** i.e. **_Providing an updated menu all times._**
We have literally experienced the way things go through in the **restaurant** so keeping that in mind the following drawbacks were recorded.

- Maintenance - i.e. Typically menu are in files, or some plastic cases which nee to be taken care.
- Slow to update - Since its paper, updating task becomes a problem for the customers.
- Separate special boards (Today's special)
- Production Cost - Production cost of different menus like bar section, cuisine.
- Usage of paper

Keeping in mind the drawbacks we decided why not switch up to a **digital** menu, as it will help us take care of various problems.

- Better return on investment - Saving time and money from the digital menu, will allow us to invest it in some other tasks.
- Flexible to change - Updating the list of items/dishes becomes very easy digitally.
- More attractive with real photos - Actual product photos are being showed, which will help us get an idea on what are we ordering.
- Saves paper
- Serves customers better (Suggestions provided) - As, customer goes through the dishes, other items/dishes are suggested that go well with the particular dish you have ordered.
